# 🚀 Mission Mars – A Computer Graphics Project

**Mission Mars** is a C++ computer graphics animation project that simulates a rocket's journey from Earth to Mars. This educational and visually engaging simulation uses 2D graphics to showcase space travel—from launch, orbiting Earth, deep space navigation, Mars orbit, landing, and astronaut deployment.

## 🌍 Project Overview

The animation follows a complete space mission through the following stages:

1. **Rocket Launch from Earth**  
   - The rocket takes off from Earth’s surface with launch smoke and ascent animation.
   - Background stars gradually appear as the rocket reaches space.

2. **Orbiting Around Earth**  
   - The rocket enters orbit around the Earth using circular motion and scaling to simulate depth.

3. **Deep Space Navigation**  
   - The rocket leaves Earth’s orbit and passes through a starfield and planetary system.
   - Mercury, Venus, and Mars are shown orbiting the Sun.

4. **Orbiting Mars**  
   - The rocket orbits Mars while the red planet rotates and revolves.

5. **Mars Landing**  
   - The rocket descends smoothly onto the Martian surface.
   - Landing gear is deployed, and a shockwave effect marks touchdown.

6. **Astronaut Deployment**  
   - An astronaut exits the rocket signifying the start of Mars exploration.
